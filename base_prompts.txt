This following text is a description of a project I am working on. Before we get going, perhaps we should rewrite this description to be more clear and concise. Then we can make an implementation plan and start working on it. 

I am creating an app for my workplace - Fremtind Forsikring. The app is a a speech-to-text app that uses the open source OpenAI Whisper model to transcribe audio files, run inside the Docker container on GPUS in AWS. The app is written in Python. The app is designed to be used by employees internally for transcribing audio files of meetings. 
I want the app to be able to run in a browser, and not require the user to install any software on their computer. When visiting the app, the user should be able to upload an audio file, and the app should transcribe the audio file and display the result in the browser. It should also be possible to record audio directly in the browser and transcribe it in real-time.
I am unsure of what frontend framework to use. I have experience with React, but I am not sure if it is the best choice for this app. I am also unsure of what backend framework to use. I have experience with FastAPI, but I am not sure if it is the best choice for this app.
I have already created an app on this machine that transcribes audio using the NBWhisper-model and you should look into this repo for inspiration. That application is located at /home/oo7knutson/Dev/NBWhisper.   
The app should be easy to use and have a modern, clean design. It should be easy to navigate and understand. The app should use the "Jøkul" design system as this is what is the official design for Fremtind - located here: https://jokul.fremtind.no/
I have also createad another app that is connecting to AWS Bedrock and is using an LLM to generate summaries of the transcribed text. That application is located at /home/oo7knutson/Dev/DOKAI. I want to reuse the logic for connecting to and using AWS Bedrock in this app. 
I want to be able to have this application live in a github repo and be able to deploy it to AWS using CI/CD.   So that whenever the code is updated, the app should be automatically deployed to AWS.
I also want to document the process of this app being built and deployed to AWS so that I can copy this process to other apps in the future.

Lets now add an important idea that I will develop later, perhaps to the implementation plan and the readme. 

What I eventually want is for users in the Fremtind organization to be able to log in using the IAM service we have with AWS, so that they are uniquely identifyed. This will make it possible to offer indiviual storage and handling of private recordings. What I am sure of is that every day there are 1-hour to 2 hour meetings that all have important information about the daily workings and development of this company. the knowledge that is created, and can be put into a system, especially if the data is at the least semi-curated by individuals, enabled by Thales capabilities, will  then create "summaries" that can be used in for instance a knowledge base or a RAG system. So - i think users can choose themselves to record sessions with for instance a colleague or a leader showing them something and then be able as a logged in user to further push that new knowledge to either a private knowledgebase, a common one or both
