I am creating an app for my workplace - Fremtind Forsikring. The app is a a speech-to-text app that uses the open source OpenAI Whisper model to transcribe audio files, run inside the Docker container on GPUS in AWS. The app is written in Python. The app is designed to be used by employees internally for transcribing audio files of meetings. 
I want the app to be able to run in a browser, and not require the user to install any software on their computer. When visiting the app, the user should be able to upload an audio file, and the app should transcribe the audio file and display the result in the browser. It should also be possible to record audio directly in the browser and transcribe it in real-time.
I am unsure of what frontend framework to use. I have experience with React, but I am not sure if it is the best choice for this app. I am also unsure of what backend framework to use. I have experience with FastAPI, but I am not sure if it is the best choice for this app.
I have already created an app on this machine that transcribes audio using the NBWhisper-model and you should look into this repo for inspiration. That application is located at /home/oo7knutson/Dev/NBWhisper.   
The app should be easy to use and have a modern, clean design. It should be easy to navigate and understand. The app should use the "Jøkul" design system as this is what is the official design for Fremtind - located here: https://jokul.fremtind.no/
I have also createad another app that is connecting to AWS Bedrock and is using an LLM to generate summaries of the transcribed text. That application is located at /home/oo7knutson/Dev/DOKAI. I want to reuse the logic for connecting to and using AWS Bedrock in this app. 
I want to be able to have this application live in a github repo and be able to deploy it to AWS using CI/CD.   So that whenever the code is updated, the app should be automatically deployed to AWS.
